# DSD Challenge Running App

This app is developed to help you tracking bosses in the FromSoftware games!

You have access to all the bosslists. You can check bosses and track your progress in the app.

After beating all the bosses for a given game, you can submit a run. A run can be Champion or Legend.

- Champion run: Complete the run at SL1, RL1, BV or BL4
- Legend run: Complete the run at SL1, RL1, BV or BL4 with a worthy handicap/restriction

For more information about these Challenge runs, 
check out

[DSD Discord Server](https://discord.gg/invite/darksouls3)

If you don't want to challenge run, you can choose the option 'Casual'. This way, you can keep track of defeated bosses without having to think about Challenge Running!

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me or ask help in the Discord Server!
